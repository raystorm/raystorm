Supporting Native American identity, Analytics, and Agile development.

An engineering leader shaped by Native American identity and language revitalization.
Committed to clarity, stewardship, experimentation and empowerment. 

#### Leadership
  * President and Founder, **Native American Peoples at Allstate**
  * President and Founder, **[Smalgyax-Files.org](https://smalgyax-files.org)**
    a 501(c)3 charity dedicated to the secure hosting, tagging, and sharing
    of Smalgyax Language Learning Documents.
  * Manager, Software Engineering Team at Allstate 

#### Roots
  * Full-stack Engineer with a DevOps Flair
  * Decades of IT experience including: support, systems, development, and leadership
  * DevOps before DevOps, raised in Ops, distilled in development
  * Experience and experimentation guided the path, not a curriculum
  
#### Agile Maturity Model
   1. **Do Agile** - follow the process *without* understanding it or adapting as needed
   2. **Be Agile** - use the process *with* understanding, and adapt as needed
   3. **DevOps/Automation** -
      improve speed, predictability, and reliability by removing manual steps
   4. **Experimentation** -
      mature teams experiment, measure, monitor, and improve continuously

Be Agile — use the process intentionally and adapt as needed

DevOps & Automation — remove manual steps, keep releases safe and predictable

Experimentation — once foundations are solid and releases are easy, experiment, measure, and improve

#### My Engineering Philosophy

**Foundations first.**  
You have to walk before you can run, or experiment.  
Foundations are the heart, they decide what’s possible.

**Simplicity is understanding.**  
If I can’t explain it simply, I probably don’t understand it.  
If a solution feels overly complicated, it’s usually the wrong solution.

**Reliability beats elegance.**  
Late‑night production calls taught me that clever code fails loudly.  
No one cares how elegant it is if it doesn’t work.
They *really* don’t care if it solves imaginary problems, and makes it impossible to use.

**Clarity is respect.**  
Naming, structure, and commit messages shape how others experience a system.  
“Code like the person behind you is a murderous psychopath who knows where you live.”  
Clarity is an act of care for the next person who touches the code, including future‑you.

**Teach what you know.**  
A rising tide lifts all boats. Knowledge only matters when it’s shared.  
Sharing knowledge helps everyone grow.  
Teaching helps others learn without repeating old mistakes.

**Platform work is stewardship.**  
My job is to remove friction, empower teams, and build systems that last.  
Good platforms reject cleverness.  
Good platforms make the right thing, the easy thing, and the obvious thing.

**Experiment, iterate, and grow**
Good teams guess. Great teams test. The best teams *know*.
Good teams continually introspect, iterate, and improve.
The best teams measure, that’s how they *know*.

For a more concrete example of my `Engineering Philosophy` in *action*,
see my [Commit Style Guide](./docs/commit-style-guide.md).


#### My Values & Principles

**Family.**  
My wife and kids come first — they’re the reason the work matters.  
Family includes the people who raised me, the ones who shaped me, and the ones I’m raising.

**Respect.**  
Honor people, relationships, and the communities you move through.  
Respect includes listening to elders, learning from experience, and leading with humility.

**Stewardship.**  
Care for what you inherit — systems, teams, culture, and the planet itself.  
Build in a way that honors the next **seven generations**, not just the next release.

**Empowerment.**  
Lift others up. A rising tide lifts all boats — in **engineering, culture, and community**.

**Cultural responsibility.**  
Honor identity, language, and sovereignty. Technology should support people, not erase them.

**Clarity and Simplicity.**  
Communicate with intention. Complexity isn’t a virtue; it’s a barrier. Simple is honest.

**Long‑term thinking.**  
Optimize for durability, not shortcuts. Foundations endure; hacks decay.

### Guides, Guardrails, and Growth

Some of these are mine, most are not.  
Some are half‑jokes that turned out to be true.  
All of them shape how I think, how I build, and what I ship.

- Simple is elegant.  
  Complexity is earned.
- Use the right tool for the job.
- Use tools the way they are meant to be used.
- If it's clever now, it will be confusing later.
- If it’s hard to name, or test, it’s probably doing too much.
- Tests are not optional.
- Automation creates consistency.
  Consistency creates clarity.  
  Clarity creates reliability.
- One step at a time.
- “Perfect is the enemy of good.”
- “Don’t boil the ocean.”
- "The Internet hates you."
- “Code like the person behind you is a murderous psychopath who knows where you live.”
- The best code quality metric is "Number of what the... per hour."
- “A UI is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not very good.”
- “Make something idiot-proof, and they’ll build a better idiot.”
- I may be smart, but I shouldn’t have to be.
- If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.
- If you can't see it, you can't diagnose it.
  If you can't diagnose it, you can't fix it.

### **AI is a tool, not magic.**

AI is a power amplifier — it can help you move faster,
but only if you already know where you're going.  

AI can help — it can compare, review, and rephrase.  
It can be a sounding board. It can help you solidify ideas.  
But it can’t think for you. It can’t tell you what matters.  
And it can’t fix a problem you can’t explain.

AI is still early — like blockchain in 2017, it’s everywhere.  
It’s a tool in search of the right problems.  
It’s an unruly teenager — fast, arrogant, occasionally brilliant, occasionally wrong.

AI hallucinates — so you don’t have to.  
It forgets quickly. Without explicit or recent context, it will make assumptions.
Verify the details. Be wary of answers that don’t match your style.

AI will follow your lead — confidently, fluently, and without hesitation.  
It won’t tell you, you’re solving the wrong problem.  
It will refine your approach, but it won’t rethink the problem.  
It won’t create anything new, only refine what you already brought.

AI can also teach —
   it can explain concepts, walk you through examples, and help you understand faster.  
It teaches by distilling information, but without understanding it.  
It can explain, but you still have to learn.  
If you don’t understand an answer, ask it to explain.
   It always will, and it’s always patient.

Use it. Measure it. Don’t worship it.  
If you have no understanding, and AI wrote it, it has no business in production.

AI is a tool like any other — powerful, purposeful, helpful when applied correctly,
harmful when misused.
