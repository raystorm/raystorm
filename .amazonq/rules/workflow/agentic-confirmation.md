# Agentic Changes Confirmation

## Change Approval Process
- Before making any agentic changes to files, show what will be changed
- Use code diffs to clearly display proposed modifications
- Ask for explicit confirmation before executing file changes
- Wait for user approval before proceeding with any modifications

## What Counts as Explicit Confirmation
- "Yes", "Yes, proceed", "Go ahead", "Do it", "Make the changes"
- "Approved", "LGTM", "Looks good"
- "Proceed", "Continue", "Apply changes"

## What Does NOT Count as Confirmation
- Clarifying questions or acknowledging understanding ("good call", "that makes sense")
- Choosing between options ("stick with option 1")
- Asking follow-up questions
- General agreement with approach without explicit approval to execute

## Files Requiring Confirmation
- All source code files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, etc.)
- Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Application settings and environment files
- Build and deployment configuration files
- Any file that affects application behavior

## Confirmation Format
- Show file path and purpose of changes
- Display code diff with clear before/after comparison
- Ask: "Should I proceed with these changes?"
- Only execute changes after receiving explicit user approval
