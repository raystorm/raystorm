# **SECTION TWO — THE WHAT (Saved Version)**

> “Before I wrote any code, I did the responsible thing: I tried to use an existing tool.
>
> I started with Nuxeo — an ‘open source’ ECM that looked promising.  
> But a lot of the features I needed were locked behind a paywall.
> Not optional features — *core* features.
> And once I tried to operationalize it in the cloud, the hosting costs 
> were completely unrealistic for a volunteer community.
>
> So I moved on and looked for cloud‑native options.  
> I evaluated every managed service and SaaS‑style ECM I could find.
>
> And the math was brutal.  
> Even the cheapest cloud‑native ECM options were priced for enterprises, not for a small language community.
>
> At some point, I realized something simple:  
> **I could write my own software and host it for a fraction of the cost.**
>
> And to be clear — domain modeling wasn’t the blocker.  
> Enterprise tools *can* handle custom fields and custom types.  
> The problem was price.  
> The problem was operational cost.  
> The problem was that every viable option assumed enterprise budgets and enterprise infrastructure.
>
> So the only realistic path forward was to build something myself,
> something lightweight, maintainable, and cost‑efficient enough
> that a volunteer‑run nonprofit could actually sustain it.
>
> And I built it because the need was real, and I happened to be in the rare position
> of having both the engineering background and the domain knowledge
> to build the right tool for the actual problem, in the right way.
>
> In other words:  
> **I didn’t build a website. I built a custom ECM system that a community could actually afford to run.**
>
> And once that system existed — once it was real, deployable, and ready — that’s when the nonprofit became necessary.”
