# **SECTION ONE — THE INTRO (THE WHY)**
*(This is the version we’ve refined together — preserved here so you don’t have to reconstruct it.)*

> “My day job used to be supporting an enterprise content management system — building and maintaining the platform the organizers relied on.
>
> When I joined my community group, I saw the same problem I saw at work: knowledge scattered everywhere. Facebook posts. Dropbox links. Google Drives. Email attachments. Nothing lived in one place.
>
> And the group taught me something that stuck:  
> **If you want to see a change, you have to be the one to make it. No one is coming to do it for you.**
>
> That lesson is what pushed me to start looking for a solution. My first instinct was to mirror my day job — find a prebuilt tool, something off the shelf.
>
> I tried.  
> But everything was enterprise‑priced. Built for corporations, not for a volunteer community trying to preserve language and culture.
>
> So I built the site myself.  
> The platform was ready to deploy long before anything else was.
>
> Originally, I hoped my language group would be the legal umbrella. They told me they were forming a nonprofit, so I waited.  
> But months passed, and nothing materialized.
>
> Meanwhile, the platform was sitting there — finished, functional, and ready to move into the cloud.  
> And that’s when the technical reality hit:  
> **you don’t deploy a real platform to the cloud without a legal entity behind it.**
>
> So I did the thing I never planned on doing:  
> **I created the nonprofit myself.**  
> Not because I wanted to run one, but because the platform was real, the community needed it, and I couldn’t wait for someone else to make the structure real.”

That’s the full WHY.

Now we pivot.
