# **Talk Ideas**

A collection of talk concepts I may develop.
Some are fully formed; others are seeds.
Nothing here is a commitment — just a place to capture ideas worth returning to.

---

## **1. Founding a Nonprofit — Why, How, and the Technical Journey**
**Core themes**
- The human motivation behind starting the nonprofit
- Early constraints and the architectural bets
- Why AWS/Amplify made sense
- Lessons learned about sustainability, clarity, and building for real people
- What I’d do differently if starting today

**Why this talk matters**  
It blends purpose, engineering, and leadership without being self‑promotional.
It’s a story about values expressed through technical decisions.

---

## **2. Commit Style Guide — 20 Years of Evolving a Personal DSL**
**Core themes**
- How a habit became a system
- Markdown lineage and semantic bullets
- Why I finally documented it
- How AI exposed ambiguity and sharpened the guide
- What clarity looks like in practice

**Why this talk matters**  
It’s uniquely mine. It’s practical, philosophical, and grounded in lived experience.

## **3. Amplify Gen 2 Type Library (If I Build It)**
**Core themes**
- Why Amplify Gen 2 needs a types helper
- The design principles behind a clean type library
- How to build something ergonomic, intention‑revealing, and future‑proof
- Lessons learned from the migration

**Why this talk matters**  
This becomes a talk only if the project exists. If it does, it’s a great “from zero to clarity” engineering story.

---

## **4. Everyone Hates Documentation — How to Make It Suck Less**
**Core themes**
- Why documentation feels painful
- How to write docs people actually want to read
- Living documentation vs. dead artifacts
- Writing for future maintainers
- Markdown as a foundational bet
- Documentation as stewardship, not bureaucracy

**Why this talk matters**  
This is a worldview talk. It helps teams without prescribing rules.

---

## **5. Using Multiple AIs to Move Faster and Safer**
**Core themes**
- How I use different AIs for different tasks
- Why comparing answers increases safety
- How AI becomes a clarity test
- Where AI helps and where it fails
- How to avoid hallucination traps

**Why this talk matters**  
It’s practical, grounded, and avoids hype. It’s about workflow, not magic.

---

## **6. What I’ve Learned Using AI**
**Core themes**
- How AI exposed ambiguity in my own thinking
- How documentation improved because of AI
- How naming and semantics became even more important
- The emotional and cognitive shifts of working with AI
- The guardrails I’ve built for myself

**Why this talk matters**  
This is a reflective talk — less structured, more experiential. Could be merged with #5 or stand alone.

---

## **7. Code Craft, Stewardship, and the Quiet Parts of Engineering**
**Core themes**
- The invisible work that makes systems humane
- Naming as architecture
- Folder boundaries as meaning
- Avoiding accidental complexity
- Designing for future maintainers
- The philosophy behind “quiet architecture”

**Why this talk matters**  
This is the talk that expresses your engineering philosophy without being preachy.

---

## **8. Quiet Architecture — Systems Where the Work Leads and the Design Quietly Follows.**
**Core themes**
- Architecture that reveals intent without drawing attention to itself
- Why modern engineering is loud (frameworks, patterns, folder sprawl, cleverness)
- How quiet architecture emerged naturally from my habits
- The role of naming, boundaries, documentation, and guardrails
- The line: **“The hardest part of quiet architecture is naming things — because the best names document.”**
  -  V2:  **_"“The hardest part of quiet architecture is naming, because a bad name has nowhere to hide.”_**
- How quiet systems scale because they’re calm, predictable, and intention‑revealing
- Why this is a philosophy, not a methodology

---

# **Notes**
- The top three strongest talks
  (based on clarity, uniqueness, and narrative strength) are:
  * **Commit DSL**,
  * **Nonprofit Origin Story**
  * **Quiet Architecture**
  * and coming in at #4 
  * **Documentation/Stewardship**
- The others are optional expansions depending on interest, time, and future projects.
