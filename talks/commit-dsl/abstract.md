## Abstract

Commit messages are one of the most durable artifacts in software development,
yet almost no one is taught how to write them well. Over the last twenty years,
I’ve shaped a simple personal habit into a clear, semantic system—first by instinct,
then by intention, and eventually by writing it down. This talk traces that evolution:
before Markdown gave us a shared formatting language,
through the time when semantic meaning was added,
to the moment an AI captured the rules I’d long since internalized.
It’s a story about clarity, discipline, and how a commit style becomes a language.

We’ll explore how structure creates skimmability, how semantic meaning creates rules,
and how rules make the system teachable to both humans and tools.
That teachability unlocks something new: an AI that can write commits in my voice
because the system is explicit enough to follow. I’ll walk through the eras, the philosophy,
and the practical benefits for developers, teams, and workflows,
and then demonstrate it live by generating a commit message
and committing the slide deck at the end of the talk.

The session ends with a QR code linking to the full style guide, ready to download, adapt, or use.
The real takeaway isn’t my guide—it’s that every developer already has a system waiting to be
surfaced, named, refined, and shared.
