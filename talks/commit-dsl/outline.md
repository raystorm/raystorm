# **A Commitment to Commits: 20 Years of Evolving Clear, Consistent Commit Messages**

*A practical, grounded talk about clarity, iteration,  
and the surprising power of a well‑designed commit style.*

---

## **1. Opening — The Honest Truth About Commit Messages**
- Everyone writes them.
- Almost no one is taught how.
- Most developers treat them as an afterthought.
- But they’re the most durable artifact in the repo.
- And they’re the only place where intent is captured at the moment of change.

**Tone‑setting line:**
> “I didn’t set out to design a system. I just wanted my future self to understand what I did.”

## **2. Era One — Pre‑Markdown: Instinct, Not Intention**
### **2.1 The plain‑text world before Markdown**
- Usenet, IRC, early forums
- Folk formatting conventions (`*`, `_underline_`, `/italics/`, `*action*`)
- No standards, only netiquette

### **2.2 My early commits across early tools**
- Mercurial → SVN → Git
- Commits as “notes to self”
- `*` as the natural bullet
- No semantics — only readability

**Key idea:**  
I wasn’t designing anything.
I was just trying to make text readable across tools that didn’t care about formatting.

---

## **3. Era Two — Markdown: When Readability Found a Standard**
### **3.1 Markdown arrives**
- Folk syntax becomes a standard
- Bullets, emphasis, structure gain rules
- Readability becomes portable

### **3.2 My early bet on the future**
> “Someday commit messages will be rendered as Markdown.  
> And I want to be ready when that happens.”

- I wasn’t following a trend — I was anticipating the future
- I aligned my habits with Markdown long before commit rendering was common

### **3.3 The shift from instinct → intention**
- I Adopted Markdown rules
- I begin thinking about skimmability, consistency, maintainers, structure

**Key idea:**  
This is when the system becomes deliberate.

---

## **4. Era Three — The Emergence of a DSL: Semantics Take Over**
### **4.1 The realization**
- Markdown bullets already carry meaning
- `+` added, `-` removed, `*` changed
- I didn’t invent semantics — I recognized them.

### **4.2 Formalizing the system**
- `+` for added
- `*` for changed
- `-` for removed
- Commits become structured, predictable, skimmable

### **4.3 Invariants emerge**
- Meaning requires boundaries
- Semantics require consistency
- Consistency requires discipline
- Discipline creates invariants

**Key idea:**  
This is where the bullets stopped being pretty and started being true.

## **5. Era Four — Codifying the Style Guide: Writing It Down**
### **5.1 Why I documented it**
- No one asked
- No audience in mind
- Just a quiet realization that it might be useful

## **5.2 Excavating the system**
- Using AI to reflect my own habits back to me
- Discovering rules I’d followed for years but never named
- Realizing the system was already battle‑tested

## **5.3 The act of writing reveals the system**
- Finding gaps  
- Clarifying semantics  
- Tightening rules  
- Naming assumptions (e.g., plain language)  
- Testing edge cases  

**Key idea:**  
The documentation didn’t create the style.  
It revealed it.

## **6. Era Five — The AI Experiment: Testing the System**
### **6.1 Curiosity sparks an experiment**
> “I handed the style guide to an AI out of curiosity.
> I just wanted to see what would happen.”

- Asking Amazon Q to write commits using the guide
- Not automation — validation

### **6.2 Failure as feedback**
- AI exposes ambiguity
- AI follows rules literally
- Every miss reveals an unclear assumption

### **6.3 Rapid refinement**
- A handful of iterations
- The AI starts producing commit messages that look like mine
- The guide becomes teachable, repeatable, durable

**Key idea:**  
I didn’t design it for AI — but clarity is transferable.

---

## **7. Era Six — When the System Became an Artifact**
### **7.1 The shift**
- The system becomes explicit
- Documented, inspectable, referencable

## **7.2 The unexpected outcome**
> “I don’t have to write my own commits anymore.  
> My AI in my IDE knows what changed and can write them for me.”

- Only possible because the system is semantic, structured, intention‑revealing

**Key idea:**  
Once a system becomes an artifact, it becomes usable by others — including AI.

## **8. What Developers Get From This System**
### **8.1 Immediate benefits**
- Faster skimming
- Cleaner diffs
- Better code reviews
- Less cognitive load
- Clearer history
- Easier debugging
- Predictable structure

### **8.2 Team‑level benefits**
- Shared mental model
- Less confusion
- More consistent communication
- A readable project history
- A consistent commit history that reads like a story instead of noise
- Commits as micro‑templates; PRs as macro‑templates

### **8.3 AI‑level benefits**
- A style guide that can be handed to an AI
- Automatic commit generation that matches my voice
- A workflow upgrade with almost no overhead

**Key idea:**  
A system built for humans becomes even more powerful when AI can follow it too.

## **9. How to Build Your Own System**
- Start with pain
- Look for patterns
- Surface the system you already follow
- Make it visible
- Let writing create clarity
- Let clarity enable refinement
- Let refinement create durability
- Treat it as a language, not a rulebook

**Key idea:**  
You don’t need to invent a system — you need to reveal the one you already use.

---

## **10. Stewardship — Your Turn**
- Systems become acts of care
- Visibility creates responsibility
- Clarity becomes longevity
- Explicitness enables transparency
- AI amplifies the responsibility of clear systems

**Closing idea:**  
Once your system becomes an artifact, the next leap becomes possible.  
Design your own.  
It’s already there — waiting to be found, named, and handed to your future self.
