Commit Style Guide
==================

I write commit messages using a structured, domain‑driven commit style designed
for clarity, traceability, and long‑term maintainability.
My commit messages should use plain language, be concise, expressive, and easy to skim.

> [!NOTE]
> Commit bodies summarize conceptual changes.
> Bullets clarify the summary, with context, without clutter.
> Bullets distill. They don't list every detail.

1. Summary
----------

A good commit message:

  * starts with a clear, imperative header
  * uses plain, easy-to-understand language
  * uses semantic bullets to describe what changed
  * orders bullets by importance
  * groups related changes
  * uses sub‑items when helpful
  * wraps file names and code objects in backticks (ex: `` `someObjectName` ``)
  * uses domain vocabulary
  * documents invariants when relevant

The goal is to keep the commit history clean, expressive,
and easy to follow.

### 1.1 Plain Language

All commit text: headers, bullets, and sub‑items,
should be written in clear, intention‑revealing plain language.
Avoid noise, meaningless jargon, and unnecessary ceremony.
Write for future maintainers.

### 1.2 Story/Issue Linking

When working in environments with issue tracking,
Commit summaries will often begin with the link text.

---

2. Bullets
----------

The bullet system is the core of this project’s commit‑message DSL.  
Bullets communicate the *type* of change, the *importance* of the change, and the *structure* of the change.
They make commits skimmable, predictable, and easy to reason about months or years later.

The following subsections define:
  1. how bullets work,
  2. how they should be used,
  3. how they should be ordered,
  4. and how they should be grouped.

---

### 2.1 Bullet Meaning

Commit bodies use a semantic bullet system:

- `+` **Added**
- `*` **Changed / Updated / Improved** -
  *Note:* Can be used to clarify, or highlight, when something hasn't changed.
- `-` **Removed**

Bullets are indented by two spaces for clean Markdown rendering.

Example:

```
  + added isDefault to permissions checks, added tests
  * UI disables for default box now, w/ tests
  - remove JSON stringify/parse
```

Use past‑tense or neutral phrasing in bullets.

---

### 2.2 Bullet Text

As stated in rule 1.1, each Bullet Text entry should be written in plain language.

---

### 2.3 Bullet Ordering

Bullets should be ordered by importance and impact:

1. **Production‑meaningful changes**  
   (logic, behavior, domain rules, UI behavior, sagas, reducers, etc.)
2. **Test changes**  
   (new tests, updated tests, reorganized tests)
3. **Documentation changes**  
   (comments, inline docs, README updates)
4. **Formatting or incidental changes**  
   (spacing, reorganizing imports, renames that don’t affect behavior)

This ordering keeps the most important information at the top and makes commits easier to skim.

---

### 2.4 Bullet Grouping

Group bullets by conceptual area to keep commits readable.

Typical groups include:

- Domain logic
- UI changes
- Permission rules
- Tests
- Documentation
- Miscellaneous cleanup

Example:

```
  * Create/Update forces WRITE access for Owner
  * boxListSaga checks for Owned when getting boxList
  + add tests for boxRules permissions helpers
  + add tests for roles has*Access helpers
```

---

### 2.5 Bullet Sub‑Items

Use sub‑items when a single bullet covers multiple related changes,
especially when referencing multiple files or multiple steps in a refactor.

Example:

```
  * VariantOverrides for enqueueSnackBar finally work
    * -> *.d.ts
    * switched to a `type` from AlertBarTypes
```

Sub‑items should be indented consistently for readability.

---

# 3. Clarity Rules and Shorthand Syntax

These conventions support clarity, brevity, and intention‑revealing commit messages.  
They apply across all commit text, including bullets.

### 3.1 File Names and Code Objects

Mention file names **only when they clarify the change**.  
Wrap file names and code objects (functions, classes, helpers, constants, etc.) in backticks:

```
  * cleanup `verifyDateField` helper
    * `DocumentDetails.tsx` reorganized
    * `verifyDateField.ts` simplified
```

This improves clarity without cluttering the commit.

---

### 3.2 Domain Vocabulary

Use the project’s domain language consistently:

- box, user box, default box, personal box
- collection, child collection, item
- permissions, roles, access levels
- saga, test table, helpers
- `AlertBar`, `AlertView`, `BoxMembersList`, `BoxForm`

Commit messages double as domain documentation.

---

### 3.3 Renames

Use arrows to show renames or conceptual transitions:

```
  * AlertMessage (data) -> Alert
  * AlertMessage (component) -> AlertView
```

This format is compact and unambiguous.

---

### 3.4 Invariants and Rules

When a commit reinforces or proves a domain rule, state the rule explicitly in the header or bullets.

Examples:

```
  * Only 1 USER box per user.
  * Collection updates preserve contained item[]
  * Create/Update forces WRITE access for Owner
```

This makes the commit history a reliable reference for domain behavior.
